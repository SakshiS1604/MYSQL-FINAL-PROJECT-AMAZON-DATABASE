# Final Project: Amazon Database Management System
---

## üìñ Project Overview

This project focuses on designing, implementing, and managing a robust **SQL database system** tailored for an Amazon-related use case. It aims to simulate a real-world e-commerce database environment, capturing core aspects such as product management, customer orders, inventory, and transactions.

The project involves:
- **Database design** adhering to best practices in normalization to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.
- Implementation of **structured schemas** representing Amazon's business processes.
- Application of **database optimization techniques** to enhance query performance and system scalability.

## üéØ Objectives

- Design a fully normalized relational database schema for an Amazon-like e-commerce platform.
- Implement SQL scripts for creating tables, defining relationships, and enforcing constraints.
- Populate the database with sample data reflecting realistic business scenarios.
- Optimize database performance using indexing, query tuning, and other techniques.
- Demonstrate effective database management practices including backup, recovery, and transaction control.
